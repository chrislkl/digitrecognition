# Digit Recognition Neural Network Python and Tensorflow Project

This project takes in input in the form of a 28 by 28 pixel png, and predicts the digit drawn in that png.
This prediction is calculated by using 2 layers of 128 nodes in a neural network.

Ensure the png name is "mydigit.png" and that it is in the same directory as main.py

Training and testing data is sourced from the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 28x28 grayscale images, each of which displays a single handwritten digit.
